SOLID Principle ðŸ˜‡
---

1. Single Responsibility Principle
A class should only have one reason to change

2. Open Closed Principle
A class should open for extension and closed for modification

3. Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subclasses without altering the behavior

4. Interface Segregation Principle
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use

5. Dependency Inversion Principle
High level modules should not depend on low level modules
